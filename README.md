##### Welcome to my portfolio.

# Cybersecurity Portfolio

My name is Stephen Langford and thank you for coming to look at some of my work.

You will see different directories where I have organized some of the examples of my work.

## Certifications
In my **Certifications** you will find the pdfs of the certificates that I have completed.
- I am currently working on CompTIA Security+ and CompTIA Network+.

## Personal Site
My **Personal Site** directory contains more information about the **Next.js** project that I am hosting on my **Oracle Cloud Server** along with the **security hardening** I have done to reduce my **attack surface**.

You can visit my site at: **www.stephenlangford.dev**

## Database Query
In the **Database Query** you can find some examples of using SQL to query a database. 
- This is a very basic example of SQL and I plan to expand this section by combining my knowledge of statistics and SQL to create some very interesting data analysis.

## Reports
In **Reports** you will find examples of different security investigations and audits that I have completed.

## Network Analysis
In **Network Analysis** you will find examples of **packet sniffing tools** I have used.
